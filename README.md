# Gifys

This small project aims only to show gifs that are searched, obtaining them through an API

## Technologies I have used

 - [Vite js: To create and Run project more fast](https://vitejs.dev/)
 - [React Js](https://es.reactjs.org/)
 - [Chakra-UI: Library for the styles](https://chakra-ui.com/)

## Documentation and another things

The page is extremely basic, it is only about being able to search for Gifs.
As it does?

It calls a gifs API and then returns the images, it has a delay due to lazy loading, but it works.

problems to fix:

- When the page is opened, it automatically leads to the Error page, due to a bug in error handling.
- Visual corrections in the HOVER of trends


## Conclusion

it is a first project in react, in which many things can be improved, but it was satisfying to be able to create it
